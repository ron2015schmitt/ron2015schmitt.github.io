Hello and welcome to my site.  I am a software developer with broad experience, who likes clean code.  This site highlights some of my personal and independent projects, as well as my skillset.

{% assign navigation_pages = site.html_pages | sort: 'navigation_weight' %} {% for p in navigation_pages %} {% if p.navigation_weight %}
<a href="{{ p.url }}" {% if p.url == page.url %}class="active"{% endif %}> {{ p.title }} </a>
{% endif %} {% endfor %}

I am a software developer with decades of wide experience.  This site provides some samples of my work.

The site itself was created using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) which follows the [Jamstack architecture](https://jamstack.org/).

This is the base Jekyll theme. You can find out more info about customizing your Jekyll theme, as well as basic Jekyll usage documentation at [jekyllrb.com](https://jekyllrb.com/)

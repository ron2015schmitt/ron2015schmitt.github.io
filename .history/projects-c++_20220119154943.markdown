<h3 style="margin-bottom: 0; padding-bottom: 0;">C++ Numerical Library</h3>
---------
<br>

[Mathématiques](https://github.com/ron2015schmitt/Mathematiques) is numerical library for performing linear algebra, calculus, vector calculus, etc in C++ via simple MATLAB-like syntax while also providing run-time performance and memory usage of hand-coded C or Fortran.

Mathématiques distinguishes itself from other libraries by an elegance and versatility that are only possible using the features of C++11,14, and 17.

My goal is to add the rest of the fundamental features.  I am currently looking for funding.

These videos were created using matlab.  The surfaces themselves were calculated by tracing magnetic field lines, written in C++.
